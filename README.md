# Laser-Microscope-Image-Analysis
## General Description:
The code in current form is set to automate image processing of the images from the SIMX8 camera used in Laser driven shock compression experiments conducted in Dlott Lab.
The high-speed videography in the Laser driven shock compression experiment enables 8 frames of observation during/post shock compression and an additional initial stationary image.
