# Laser-Microscope-Image-Analysis
The code in current form is set to automate image processing of the images from the SIMX8 camera used in Laser driven shock compression experiments.
The high-speed videography in the Laser driven shock compression experiment enables 8 frames of observation during/post shock compression and an additional initial stationary image.     
**The functions defined can be used for other type of images based on user discretion.**
