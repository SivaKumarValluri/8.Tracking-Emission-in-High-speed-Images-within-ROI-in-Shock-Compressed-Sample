# Laser-Microscope-Image-Analysis
## General Description: ##    
The code in current form is set to automate image processing of the images from the SIMX8 camera used in Laser driven shock compression experiments conducted in Dlott Lab.   
The high-speed videography in the Laser driven shock compression experiment enables 8 frames of observation during/post shock compression and an additional initial stationary image.
The program takes the segmeneted portions of a stationary image captured before the experiment (The Regions of interest R.O.I) and tracks emissions growth within these R.O.I.
Since each frame during experiment is not backlight, the white pixels observed are emission which are then sequestered into the R.O.I

**The functions defined can be used for other type of images based on user discretion.**
